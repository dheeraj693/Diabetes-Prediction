# Diabetes-Prediction
🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Diabetes Prediction System that uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on medical diagnostic measurements.
The model is trained on the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset and deployed using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

🚀 Features

Predict diabetes based on user input (Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Insulin, BMI, etc.)

Clean and interactive Streamlit web app

Scaled and preprocessed dataset for better model accuracy

Supports both training & prediction modes

📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle.
It includes the following features:

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

Pandas, NumPy (Data handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Streamlit (Deployment)
